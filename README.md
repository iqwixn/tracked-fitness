## Description

As a fitness enthusiast, I want to be able to log into my application, so that I can see my previous workouts, create new exercises, set new goals for future workouts, and compare the two.
When I log in, I am first presented with the most recent workout belonging to the user and the option to create a new workout plan.
When I click to create a new workout, I am redirected to a new page to create specific workout sets for desired exercises for the new workout plan.
When I logout, I am unable to view user specific workouts or create new ones.
When I am about to create a new workout plan, I am able to choose either from old workout set exercises from prior workouts or add new ones. 

Introducing Tracked Fitness, your unique workout tracker. This innovative React web application provides users to effortlessly add their specific workouts to each workout plan the user intends to to per day. Upon logging in, you will be welcomed with a daily motivational quote, alongside your most recent workout, past workouts and a list of all specific exercises commonly used by the user.
